# Batch-Download
useful to download a bunch of files collectively from a site where the download links change only in indexes.

Run 'script.py' to get all the links (value of variable "n" should be changed to get the links of a particular range)

This writes all the links to be downloaded into links.txt

Run 'open.py' to download all the links (it opens the links to your browser to download).
